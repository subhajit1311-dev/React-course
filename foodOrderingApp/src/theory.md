   -`react uses one way data binding`
   -`react-variable kind of state variable ,every component in react ,maintain a state`

      -``
    -`what is hooks?why it is needed?`
      -`hooks is just a normal js function`
    -`what is the useState?`
      -`useState hook is use for creating a state variable`
      -`useState is import via "react", the function returns a array` 
    -`why do we need to create  useState hooks to make react variable?`
      -`if you want to make your component dynamic thus the need of the useState variable comes into picture`
      -`when ever state variable update ,react triggers a reconciliation cycle(re-renders the component)`
    -`Default Import`
      -`from "./components/Header.js": This specifies the location of the Header.js file. The "./components/" part means that the Header.js file is located in a folder named components within the current directory.`
    -`named Import-****`
      -`import {Title} from "./components/Header.js"` 
      -`import * as xyz from "./components/Header.js" `
      -`erom hole applayout <header/> er place e <xyz.header/>likte hoy` 
      -`using the export key word in header.js file by export keyword`
      -`functional component is a function that return jsx`
      -`config driven UI -> we control our frontend via a configuration`
      -`Body Component for body section: It contain all restaurant cards`
      -`We are mapping restaurantList array and passing data to RestaurantCard component as props with unique key as index`
    -`if no dependency array => useEffect is called on every rendering`
      -`if dependency array is empty =[] =>useEffect is called on initial render just once`
       -`if dependency array is [btnNameReact] => called everytime if btnNameReact is updated`
    -`where we don't use the useState hook`
      -`1>inside a if else condition`
      -`2>inside a for loop`
      -`3>outside of a functional component`
